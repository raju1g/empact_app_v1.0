A linear regression equation describes the relationship between the independent variables (IVs) and the dependent variable (DV). It can also predict new values of the DV for the IV values you specify.
In regression analysis, the procedure estimates the best values for the constant and coefficients. Typically, regression models switch the order of terms in the equation compared to algebra by displaying the constant first and then the coefficients. It also uses different notation, as shown below for simple regression.

Y = Î²0 + Î²1X1
Using this notation, Î²0 is the constant, while Î²1 is the coefficient for X. Multiple regression just adds more Î²kXk terms to the equation up to K independent variables (Xs).
