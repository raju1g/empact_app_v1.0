    `Involuntary turnover` of an employee in an organisation occurs when that employee leaves that organisation due to the termination of his/her/their contract. 
    
    The following reasons for involuntary turnover were considered in the analysis:
    
    - `Violation of company policies and procedures`
    - `Poor performance and attendance`
    - `Conflict with colleagues and manager`
    - `Misconduct and inappropriate behavior`
    - `Theft and fraud`

    The underlying code groups employees according to tenure and plots against the no. of turnover employees. Employees that stayed in the organisation for more than 3 years were less likely to involuntarily leave the organisation as compared to those that served for less than 3 years.

    The data is visualised using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).
