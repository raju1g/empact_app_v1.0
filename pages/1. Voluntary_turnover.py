    `Voluntary turnover` of an employee in an organisation occurs when that employee leaves that organisation without the termination of his/her/their contract. 
    
    The following reasons for voluntary turnover were considered in the analysis:
    
    - `Better salary and benefits`
    - `Lack of career growth opportunities`
    - `Relocating to another city`
    - `Poor management and work culture`
