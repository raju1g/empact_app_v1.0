[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://cohort.streamlitapp.com/)

This Cohort Analysis App calculates the `retention rate` (the percentage of active customers compared to the total number of customers, split by month). This `retention rate` is then visualized and interpreted through a heatmap.

These 	2 demos are based on the following tutorials:

### First app (`Bikes` dataset)

This demo is inspired by this [Cohort Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/maladeep/cohort-retention-rate-analysis-in-python).

This dataset came from the hypothetical `Sprocket Central Pty Ltd`, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation.

The data was collected from `January 1, 2017` to `December 31, 2017`, and available in `CSV` format, downloadable [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/archit9406/customer-transaction-dataset).

Each row in the dataset contains information about an individual bike purchase:

- Who bought it
- How much they paid
- The bike's `brand` and `product line`
- Its `class` and `size`
- What `day` the purchase happened
- The `day` when the product was first sold

The underlying code takes those purchases and groups them into cohorts and calculates the `retention rate`, split by month, so that one can answer the question:

The underlying code groups those purchases into cohorts and calculates the `retention rate` (split by month) so that one can answer the question:

*if I'm making weekly changes to my store to get people to come back and buy more bikes, are those changes working?"*

These cohorts are then visualized and interpreted through a heatmap [powered by Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

### Second app (`Food` dataset)

This demo is inspired by this [Cohort Analysis Tutorial](http://www.gregreda.com/2015/08/23/cohort-analysis-with-python/)

<img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27242399/174386573-882bee1d-38a1-435f-bdf3-a7713239e1e9.png" width="400px"></img>

This dataset comes from the hypothetical `Relay Food` company. The data spans from `June 1, 2009` to `September 3, 2010` and is available in CSV format (downloadable [here](https://github.com/springcoil/marsmodelling/blob/master/relay-foods.xlsx)).

Each row in the dataset contains information about an individual food order:

   - Who bought it
   - How much they paid
   - The pick-up date

The underlying code groups those purchases into monthly cohorts (with the user's cohort group based on their first order) and calculates the `retention rate` so that one can answer the question:

 *if I'm making monthly changes to my shop to get people to come back and order more, are those changes working?"*

These cohorts are then visualized and interpreted through a heatmap [powered by Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

### Process

Here are the steps we undertook to create the cohort analysis app:

1. Load the data 
2. Create the cohort 
3. Calculate the retention rate
4. Visualize and interpret the retention rate via the heatmap
